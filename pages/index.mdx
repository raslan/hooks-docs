# hooks

React hooks made by the [refolded](https://github.com/refolded) team for a variety of usecases.

## What is it?

At first this library included a basic implementation of a `useInterval` as well as its counterpart `useTimeout`, however we eventually realized that there's more that can be done and so the library now extends their functionality while also providing a multitude of other hooks that streamline some common usecases that could come up for timing, DOM manipulation, state management and so on.
