# useTimeout

useTimeout allows you to call a function at a given timeout, much like [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout), with the advantage of not having to wrap it in complex behaviors in `useEffect` to clear the timeout or reset.

The added benefit of a custom react hook is that the delay is dynamic, so you can dynamically change the delay parameter and on the next render the timeout will automatically re-initialize with the new delay.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  From `v2.0` onwards, useTimeout now returns an object containing `start` and
  `stop` rather than an array. These are functions that allow you to pause and
  unpause the timeout at will. All hooks below also now return an object
  instead of an array.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useTimeout } from '@refolded/use-timing'

const App = () => {
  // Classic example with a counter
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  // Set a dynamic delay, you can also pass an absolute value.
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(500)

  // The hooks return "start" and "stop" functions for controlling it.
  // Whenever the delay changes, the function dynamically reruns.
  const { start, stop } = useTimeout(() => {
    setCount(count - 1)
  }, delay)

  // Examples for changing the speed on the fly.
  const halfSpeed = () => setDelay(delay * 2)
  const doubleSpeed = () => setDelay(delay / 2)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <div>
        <button onClick={start}>Start Count</button>
        <button onClick={stop}>Stop Count</button>
        <button onClick={doubleSpeed}>Double speed</button>
        <button onClick={halfSpeed}>Half speed</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
